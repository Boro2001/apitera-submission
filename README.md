# Project Submission - Github Repository Fetching Api

This is the project submission for the Atipera preliminary recruitment process.

## Project Overview

Api fetching github repositories for given user.

## Technologies Used

Java 17, Spring Boot

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Package the project using Maven `mvn clean package`
3.  Run jar file or  use `mvn spring-boot:run`
4. Format of the request should look like this: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/{username}/repositories`

## Usage

I also hosted this tiny app on Oracle, for it allows to try this application without building project.
The endpoint is: `https://lammaat.pl/api/v1/{username}/repositories`

## Challenges Faced

I had never used Spring Boot before as a client for another api. 
I think processing of the data should be parallelized if it is possible, but
it was more difficult than synchronous processing, as well as exception management.

Thank you for considering my project submission.
